Build a desktop equipment inventory management system for safety/climbing equipment with the following requirements:

CORE FUNCTIONALITY:
- Equipment tracking with unique IDs (format: [TYPE]/[001-999] like D/001, B/002, R/003)
- 6-month mandatory inspection cycles with pass/fail results
- Three equipment statuses: Active, Red Tagged (30-day max), Destroyed
- Soft goods have 10-year lifespan from first use date
- Hardware has unlimited lifespan (inspection-dependent only)
- 7-year record retention requirement

DATABASE SCHEMA:
```sql
Equipment (
    equipment_id VARCHAR(8) PRIMARY KEY,
    equipment_type VARCHAR(2),
    serial_number VARCHAR(50),
    purchase_date DATE,
    first_use_date DATE,
    status ENUM('ACTIVE', 'RED_TAGGED', 'DESTROYED'),
    created_at TIMESTAMP
)

Equipment_Types (
    type_code VARCHAR(2) PRIMARY KEY,
    description VARCHAR(100),
    is_soft_goods BOOLEAN,
    lifespan_years INT,
    inspection_interval_months INT DEFAULT 6,
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
    sort_order INT
)

Inspections (
    inspection_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    equipment_id VARCHAR(8),
    inspection_date DATE,
    result ENUM('PASS', 'FAIL'),
    inspector_name VARCHAR(100),
    notes TEXT
)

Status_Changes (
    change_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    equipment_id VARCHAR(8),
    old_status VARCHAR(20),
    new_status VARCHAR(20),
    change_date TIMESTAMP,
    red_tag_date DATE
)
BUSINESS RULES:

Red tagged equipment never returns to service
Failed inspections automatically red tag equipment
Red tagged equipment must be destroyed after 30 days
Overdue inspection tracking (no hard blocks)
Equipment types can be added/removed dynamically

UI REQUIREMENTS:

Main dashboard with equipment list, status overview, quick actions
Equipment detail view with full inspection history
Inspection recording form with pass/fail options
Reports dashboard showing overdue inspections, red tag countdown, expiring equipment
Equipment type management (add/edit/disable type codes)
Search and filter by ID, type, status
Sort by equipment type code (D, B, R, H, etc.)

TECHNICAL SPECS:

Desktop application (suggest Electron or Python with Tkinter)
SQLite database (local file)
Offline operation required
Data export to CSV
Auto-backup functionality
Print capability for inspection reports

SAMPLE DATA:
Create with equipment types: D (Descender), R (Rope), H (Harness), B (Backup)
Add 10-15 sample equipment items with various statuses and inspection histories
Start with a basic working version focusing on:

Add/view equipment
Record inspections
Basic status management
Equipment type management

Make the UI clean and functional - prioritize usability over aesthetics.
