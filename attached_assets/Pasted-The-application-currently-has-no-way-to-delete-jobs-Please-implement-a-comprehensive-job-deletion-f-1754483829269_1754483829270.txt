The application currently has no way to delete jobs. Please implement a comprehensive job deletion feature with proper database handling.
Step 1: Add Delete Method to database_postgres.py
Create a new method delete_job() that handles the complex deletion process:
pythondef delete_job(self, job_id: str) -> tuple[bool, str]:
    """
    Delete a job and handle all related data
    Returns (success: bool, message: str)
    """
    conn = self.connect()
    try:
        cursor = conn.cursor()
        
        # 1. Check if equipment is still assigned to this job
        cursor.execute("""
            SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Equipment 
            WHERE job_id = %s AND status = 'IN_FIELD'
        """, (job_id,))
        
        equipment_count = cursor.fetchone()[0]
        if equipment_count > 0:
            return False, f"Cannot delete job. {equipment_count} equipment items are still assigned to this job. Please return all equipment first."
        
        # 2. Check for related invoices
        cursor.execute("""
            SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Invoices 
            WHERE job_number = %s
        """, (job_id,))
        
        invoice_count = cursor.fetchone()[0]
        if invoice_count > 0:
            return False, f"Cannot delete job. This job has {invoice_count} related invoice(s). Please delete the invoices first."
        
        # 3. Clear any equipment references (for WAREHOUSE/ACTIVE equipment that was previously assigned)
        cursor.execute("""
            UPDATE Equipment 
            SET job_id = NULL 
            WHERE job_id = %s
        """, (job_id,))
        
        # 4. Delete billing record
        cursor.execute("""
            DELETE FROM Job_Billing 
            WHERE job_id = %s
        """, (job_id,))
        
        # 5. Finally delete the job
        cursor.execute("""
            DELETE FROM Jobs 
            WHERE job_id = %s
        """, (job_id,))
        
        if cursor.rowcount == 0:
            return False, "Job not found"
        
        conn.commit()
        return True, "Job deleted successfully"
        
    except Exception as e:
        conn.rollback()
        return False, f"Error deleting job: {str(e)}"
    finally:
        conn.close()
Step 2: Add Route in app.py
Add a new route to handle job deletion:
python@app.route('/job/<job_id>/delete', methods=['POST'])
@auth.require_auth
def delete_job(job_id):
    """Delete a job after validation checks"""
    try:
        # Call the delete method
        success, message = db_manager.delete_job(job_id)
        
        if success:
            flash(message, 'success')
            return redirect(url_for('jobs_dashboard'))
        else:
            flash(message, 'error')
            return redirect(url_for('job_details', job_id=job_id))
            
    except Exception as e:
        flash(f'Error deleting job: {str(e)}', 'error')
        return redirect(url_for('job_details', job_id=job_id))
Step 3: Add Delete Button to Job Details Page
In templates/job_details.html, add a delete button in the actions section (near the Edit Job button):
html<!-- Add this after the Edit Job button -->
<button type="button" class="btn btn-danger" onclick="confirmDeleteJob()">
    <i class="bi bi-trash"></i> Delete Job
</button>
And add this JavaScript function at the bottom of the template:
javascriptfunction confirmDeleteJob() {
    // Check job status first
    const jobStatus = '{{ job.status }}';
    
    if (jobStatus === 'ACTIVE') {
        alert('Cannot delete an ACTIVE job. Please change the status to COMPLETED or CANCELLED first.');
        return;
    }
    
    // Check for assigned equipment
    const equipmentRows = document.querySelectorAll('tr[data-equipment-id]');
    if (equipmentRows.length > 0) {
        alert('Cannot delete this job. Please return all assigned equipment first.');
        return;
    }
    
    // Final confirmation
    if (confirm('Are you sure you want to permanently delete this job?\n\nJob: {{ job.job_id }} - {{ job.customer_name }}\n\nThis action cannot be undone.')) {
        // Create and submit form
        const form = document.createElement('form');
        form.method = 'POST';
        form.action = '{{ url_for("delete_job", job_id=job.job_id) }}';
        document.body.appendChild(form);
        form.submit();
    }
}
Step 4: Add Delete Option to Jobs Dashboard (Optional)
In templates/jobs_dashboard.html, add a delete button to the actions column for jobs that can be deleted:
html<!-- In the actions column, add this after the Edit button -->
{% if job.status not in ['ACTIVE'] %}
<form method="POST" action="{{ url_for('delete_job', job_id=job.job_id) }}" 
      style="display: inline;"
      onsubmit="return confirm('Delete job {{ job.job_id }}? This cannot be undone.');">
    <button type="submit" class="btn btn-sm btn-outline-danger" title="Delete Job">
        <i class="bi bi-trash"></i>
    </button>
</form>
{% endif %}
Business Rules for Job Deletion:

Cannot delete if equipment is assigned (status = IN_FIELD)
Cannot delete if invoices exist for the job
Should warn if job is ACTIVE (recommend changing status first)
Clears job_id references from any equipment that was previously assigned
Deletes billing record automatically
Requires confirmation before deletion

Expected Results:

Jobs can be deleted from the job details page
Proper validation prevents deletion of jobs with active dependencies
Clear error messages guide users on what needs to be done before deletion
Database integrity is maintained through proper cleanup of related records
