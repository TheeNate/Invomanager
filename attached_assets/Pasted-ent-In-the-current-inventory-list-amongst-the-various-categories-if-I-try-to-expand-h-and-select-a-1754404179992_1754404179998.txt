In the current inventory list amongst the various categories if I try to expand h and select any of the individual pieces of equipment I get this error:  Error loading equipment details: No filter named 'strptime' found. Can you tell me why this is happening and how to fix it I don't want you to write any code I want you to help me draft the prompt to give to replit to fix the issue.

Based on the project knowledge search, I can see exactly what's causing the error. The issue is that somewhere in your Flask application templates, there's code trying to use strptime as a Jinja2 template filter, but this filter hasn't been defined in your Flask app.

Looking at the template files, I can see in job_details.html there's this line:

html
<dd class="col-sm-8">{{ job.created_at.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M') if job.created_at else 'Unknown' }}</dd>
The error suggests that somewhere the code is trying to use strptime instead of strftime, or there's a template attempting to parse a date string using strptime as a filter.

Here's the prompt you should give to Replit to fix this:

Bug Fix Needed: "No filter named 'strptime' found" Error

I'm getting an error "No filter named 'strptime' found" when trying to view equipment details in the inventory system. After investigating, I believe this is happening because:

There's likely a template somewhere using strptime as a Jinja2 filter, but this filter hasn't been registered in the Flask app
OR there's a typo where strptime is being used instead of strftime
Required fixes:

First, search all template files (especially equipment_details.html and related templates) for any usage of strptime and verify if it should be strftime instead
If strptime is intentionally being used as a filter, add this template filter to app.py:
python
@app.template_filter('strptime')
def strptime_filter(date_string, format='%Y-%m-%d'):
    """Parse date string for templates"""
    if not date_string:
        return None
    try:
        return datetime.strptime(date_string, format)
    except (ValueError, TypeError):
        return None
Check the equipment details route and template specifically since that's where the error occurs when clicking on individual equipment items
Review any date handling code in templates that might be trying to parse date strings rather than format datetime objects
Please investigate and fix whichever scenario applies, ensuring all date operations in templates either:

Use strftime for formatting datetime objects to strings
Use a properly registered strptime filter for parsing strings to datetime objects
Handle None/empty values gracefully
This is blocking users from viewing individual equipment details, so it's a critical functionality issue that needs immediate resolution.
